      `Web Development refers to the creation (and consequent maintenance and upgradation) of a holistic and comprehensive website for your business. To further enhance the website in its aesthetics and usability, Web Design is combined with the Development process. These services bring along other services such as cybersecurity, UX/UI design, eCommerce solutions, website architectures, web consulting, web content management, and more.`,

      `Back-end developers use coding languages like Python, Java or Node.js to work on behind-the-scenes logic and functionality of the website. This involves programming the server, APIs, handling data processing, authentication, encryption, and much more.`,
      `At the same time, front-end web developers and designers work in coordination to create the client-facing side of the website. Using tools such as Figma, WordPress and Webflow, designers formulate the structural layout, navigation and interactivity (User Experience) along with the visual appearance such as colors, typography, images and icons (User Interface). Front-end developers code these into working through languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.`,
