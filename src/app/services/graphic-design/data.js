      `Graphic design is the amalgamation of art and technology that creates captivating visuals for various purposes such as creative logo design, web banner design and more. Though creativity is important, the main objective of graphic design is to make information easy to comprehend. Thus, creativity should go hand-in-hand with simplicity.`,

Graphics range from static visuals to UI and motion graphics.`,
